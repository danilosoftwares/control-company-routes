## Flux Process
![](flux.png)  

## Downloading and running application without cloning repository
```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danilosoftwares/control-company-routes/main/.env
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danilosoftwares/control-company-routes/main/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

## Cloning repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/danilosoftwares/control-company-routes.git
```

## Downloading and Running the Application in Docker
Only with Docker installed is it possible to run the application that will generate a postgres database with a previously created table and with a backend in nodejs and frontend in reactjs.

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Building and Running the Application in Docker Locally
Only with Docker installed is it possible to build and run the local application directly from the repository, where it will upload the database in Postgres and generate the table necessary for using the API and the frontend.
Just have the terminal in the repository folder of the docker-compose file and run the following command:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up -d
```

## Using the local application
After running or building/running the local application, it is possible to access the API on the host http://localhost:3003/ and access the application frontend on the host http://localhost:3004/

# BackEnd

The Application used the following items:
- Frameworks
    - [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
    - [Postgres](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg)
- DataBase
    - [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
